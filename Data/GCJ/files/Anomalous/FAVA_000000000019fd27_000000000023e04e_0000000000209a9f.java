public static void main(String[] args) {}
```

Here's a breakdown of the corrected code:
- `public`: This is an access modifier that allows the method to be accessible from anywhere.
- `static`: This allows the method to be called without creating an instance of the class.
- `void`: This indicates that the method does not return any value.
- `main`: This is the name of the method. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for this method as the entry point of any Java application.
- `String[] args`: This is an array of `String` objects, which stores command-line arguments passed to the program.

So, the rewritten code while maintaining functionality is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {}
