It appears there was a mix-up in the language. The code provided is actually in Python, not Java. I'll rewrite the given Python code while maintaining its functionality and improving readability.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def schedule_activities(test_cases, cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(test_cases):
        number_of_activities = cases[i][0]
        activities = cases[i][1]
        cameron_end_time = -1
        jaime_end_time = -1
        ordered_sequence = OrderedDict()
        
        for activity in activities:
            start, end = activity
            if str(activity) in ordered_sequence:
                secondary_str = str(activity) + "_1"
                if secondary_str in ordered_sequence:
                    results.append(f"Case #{i + 1}: IMPOSSIBLE")
                    break
                else:
                    ordered_sequence[secondary_str] = None
            else:
                ordered_sequence[str(activity)] = None
        else:
            activities.sort()
            cameron_end_time = activities[0][1]
            ordered_sequence[str(activities[0])] = 'C'
            
            for activity in activities[1:]:
                start, end = activity
                secondary_str = str(activity) + "_1"
                
                if start >= cameron_end_time:
                    cameron_end_time = end
                    if ordered_sequence[str(activity)] is not None:
                        ordered_sequence[secondary_str] = 'C'
                    else:
                        ordered_sequence[str(activity)] = 'C'
                elif start >= jaime_end_time:
                    jaime_end_time = end
                    if ordered_sequence[str(activity)] is not None:
                        ordered_sequence[secondary_str] = 'J'
                    else:
                        ordered_sequence[str(activity)] = 'J'
                else:
                    break
            else:
                schedule = ''.join(value for value in ordered_sequence.values() if value is not None)
                if len(schedule) < number_of_activities:
                    results.append(f"Case #{i + 1}: IMPOSSIBLE")
                else:
                    results.append(f"Case #{i + 1}: {schedule}")
    return results

# Example usage:
test_cases = int(input())
cases = []

for _ in range(test_cases):
    number_of_activities = int(input())
    activities = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(number_of_activities)]
    cases.append((number_of_activities, activities))

results = schedule_activities(test_cases, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This refactored code maintains the original functionality but improves readability by using functions and structured input handling. It also correctly handles the case of multiple activities with the same start and end times.
